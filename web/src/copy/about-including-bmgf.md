## About this service

### SPC-PILs

Patient information leaflet (PILs) are found in every medicine pack,
and provide information on how a medicine should be used safely.

Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs) are descriptions of a
medicinal product’s properties and the conditions attached to its use.
A PIL will be based on an SPC.

We publish the most up-to-date information for a medicine according to
its licence history. PILs can be updated several times during the product’s lifecycle, so
the leaflet a patient gets with their medicine could be different to
the one found here.

We hold data for medicines licensed at a national (UK) level. Some
medicines are licensed by the European Medicines Agency
(EMA). For product information on these medicines, [use the EMA website][ema].

Once a marketing authorisation has been cancelled, the product
information will stay on the website for a year.

Market authorisation holders have 6 months to exhaust stocks after
they cancel their product. This means the PILs will still be available
on the website during this period, with an extra 6 months for patients
who still have the product at home.

If you have any questions or comments on this list of product
information, please [contact our Customer Services Team][customer services].

### PARs

We make scientific assessment reports called PARs (Public Assessment
Reports) for new marketing authorisations granted after 30 October 2005.

We also publish PARs for all marketing authorisation applications that
were refused after 1 April 2019.

PARs are published and edited in accordance with a specific EC
Directive, 2004/27/EC.

For some medicines licensed at a European level, the PARs are prepared
by either the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the responsible
authority of another EU member state. The PARs for these medicines can
be found on the following websites:

[European Medicines Agency (EMA)][ema medicine]

[Head of Medicines Agency][head of med]

### Changes to PARs

Subsequent non-safety changes (variations) of clinical significance
for each marketing authorisation are provided at the end of each PAR
as separate annexes.

Minor changes to a marketing authorisation, for example, changes in
pack sizes and minor updates to the product literature, may not be
represented in the PAR.

We also publish [Safety Public Assessment Reports][spar], which provide
details of significant safety changes to a marketing authorisation.

### Medicine levels in pregnancy reports

This includes summaries of pregnancy pharmacokinetics data available in the literature and evaluations of a pregnancy mathematical modelling technique known as physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) modelling that is used by healthcare professionals to predict drug exposure in pregnant women.
