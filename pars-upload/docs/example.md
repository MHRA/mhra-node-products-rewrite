# Example use of PARs upload form.

After authenticating, an authorised user will be able to continue to upload a new PAR file.

## Step 1: Filling the form

This is quite simple.
It looks like this:

![form filled with 'Craig' product details][filled form]

## Step 2: Receiving submission

In the first, most basic version of this form, the call is synchronous.

We are told that there has been a success, and that the upload has placed the file at a given URL.

![sucess message with URL to the uploaded file][success message]

A user would now be able to [access the file they have uploaded][uploaded file].

[filled form]: ./assets/filled-form.png
[success message]: ./assets/success-message.png
[uploaded file]: https://mhraproductsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/docs/6882f28b6368175170b31bda8f51ab5d243246d5
